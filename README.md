- 👋 Hi, I’m Raghav Puri.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning different coding languages or at least trying my hand at them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R.
- 💞️ I’m creating a code repository that aims to contain everything one needs to learn and operate R. Whatever I learn and discover, I will put it here for everyone to access.

<!---
itsraghavpuri/itsraghavpuri is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
